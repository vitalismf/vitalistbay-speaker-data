    "Biography": "<p id=\"\">Dr Jack Scannell is best known for his work to diagnose the causes of the progressive decline in R&amp;D productivity in the drug and biotechnology industry. He coined the term ‚ÄúEroom‚Äôs Law‚Äù (from computer science‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoore‚Äôs Law‚Äù spelled backwards) to describe the contrast between falling biopharma R&amp;D output efficiency since 1950 in the face of spectacular gains in basic science and in the brute force efficiency of the scientific activities on which drug discovery is generally believed to depend. His work has considered the contributions of scientific, economic, regulatory, and organisational factors. Recently, he has focused on the predictive validity of screening and disease models in drug R&amp;D, which constitute perhaps the major productivity bottleneck. Dr Scannell is currently the CEO of Etheros Pharmaceuticals Corp. Etheros is developing small molecule enzyme mimetics, based on fullerene chemistry, for age-related and neurodegenerative diseases. He is an Associate of the Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation Studies at Edinburgh University. He led Discovery Biology at e-Therapeutics PLC, an Oxford-based biotech firm. He has experience in drug and biotech investment at UBS and at Sanford Bernstein where he ran the European Healthcare teams.

Dr. Conboy's research has significantly contributed to the understanding of how aging affects stem cell function and tissue regeneration. Notably, his work on heterochronic parabiosis‚Äîjoining the circulatory systems of young and old mice‚Äîhas provided insights into the role of systemic factors in aging. This research suggests that aging is influenced by a balance of positive and negative factors in the blood, and that modifying these factors can promote tissue repair and rejuvenation. Through his research, Dr. Conboy aims to develop interventions that restore youthful regenerative potential, thereby promoting healthy aging and extending the human healthspan.</p>",
