    "Position": "Founder and Neuroengineer, Eightsix Science",
    "Biography": "<p>Daniel Burger is a neuroengineer and entrepreneur dedicated to advancing the field of neurotechnology. As the founder of Eightsix Science, he leads efforts to develop augmented progressive brain replacement—a radical procedure aimed at treating neurodegeneration, brain injuries, and aging through patient-specific neural grafts designed for piece-wise replacement and neuronal-level modulation. Daniel's research focuses on ectopic cognitive preservation, an approach to sustain cognition outside its original biological context. He has contributed to projects ranging from whole-brain simulations at the Blue Brain Project to closed-loop control of virtual avatars using human brain organoids at FinalSpark. Fundamentally, Daniel treats death as an engineering challenge to be solved and aspires to research better substrates for synthetic consciousness in the long run.</p>",

    "Biography": "<p id=\"\">Dr Jack Scannell is best known for his work to diagnose the causes of the progressive decline in R&amp;D productivity in the drug and biotechnology industry. He coined the term “Eroom’s Law” (from computer science’s “Moore’s Law” spelled backwards) to describe the contrast between falling biopharma R&amp;D output efficiency since 1950 in the face of spectacular gains in basic science and in the brute force efficiency of the scientific activities on which drug discovery is generally believed to depend. His work has considered the contributions of scientific, economic, regulatory, and organisational factors. Recently, he has focused on the predictive validity of screening and disease models in drug R&amp;D, which constitute perhaps the major productivity bottleneck. Dr Scannell is currently the CEO of Etheros Pharmaceuticals Corp. Etheros is developing small molecule enzyme mimetics, based on fullerene chemistry, for age-related and neurodegenerative diseases. He is an Associate of the Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation Studies at Edinburgh University. He led Discovery Biology at e-Therapeutics PLC, an Oxford-based biotech firm. He has experience in drug and biotech investment at UBS and at Sanford Bernstein where he ran the European Healthcare teams. He has a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Oxford University and a degree in medical sciences from Cambridge University.</p>",

In 2022, Watanabe authored \"From Biological to Artificial Consciousness: Neuroscientific Insights and Progress,\". This book approaches the problem of emergent consciousness through scientific studies that shed light on the neural mechanism of consciousness, and furthermore, delves into the possibility of artificial consciousness, a phenomenon that may ultimately solve the mystery. The novel lays out a new and credible pathway to mind-uploading through a method to test machine consciousness and a theory hypothesizing that consciousness emerges from a neural algorithm.</p>",

Dr. Conboy's research has significantly contributed to the understanding of how aging affects stem cell function and tissue regeneration. Notably, his work on heterochronic parabiosis—joining the circulatory systems of young and old mice—has provided insights into the role of systemic factors in aging. This research suggests that aging is influenced by a balance of positive and negative factors in the blood, and that modifying these factors can promote tissue repair and rejuvenation. Through his research, Dr. Conboy aims to develop interventions that restore youthful regenerative potential, thereby promoting healthy aging and extending the human healthspan.</p>",
